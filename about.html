        <h2 style="text-align:center;">About Us</h2>
   <p>The Wild Animal Sanctuary is all about saving animals to prevent and alleviate cruelty to animals which are abandoned or were subject to deprivation or neglect, by providing care and boarding.</p>
    
        <p> Every Lion, Tiger, Bear, Wolf and other large carnivore living at the Sanctuary was rescued from an illegal or abusive situation and desperately needs your help to survive.  Visiting the Sanctuary is a privilege, and requires a serious commitment by people in order to be part of the solution to the Captive Wildlife Crisis.</p>
        
        
  <p> We rescue and provide life-long homes for large, exotic and endangered captive wild animals and to educate the public about the causes of and solutions to the worldâ€™s captive wildlife crisis.</p>
   
        <p> Our goal is to give them a life of dignity and respect and to make their life as it would be if they could choose. We also work tirelessly to educate humans about the causes of, and solutions to, the Captive Wildlife Crisis.</p>
    
        <p> Please consider making a Donation to the Sanctuary to help support our important work.  Your donation today will help us rescue & rehabilitate more animals, as well as provide them with large acreage natural habitats to live in the rest of their lives.</p>
